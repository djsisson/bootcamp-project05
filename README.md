<!-- Our domain model
<!-- Project domain model --> -->

The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems:
People in bookclubs are not always able to know what others are reading without asking. In a busy world it can be hard to keep on top of what others are doing. This website allows all members to connect anywhere anytime with the community and keep updated on what others are reading.

Our project solves those problems by:

Providing a virtual space for club members to connect and share with like minded individuals without the need to be phyiscally present.
